# MIPS Processor in VHDL

This project is a college assignment that implements a 16-bit RISC MIPS processor in VHDL. It includes two variants: a single-cycle processor and a pipelined processor, each aimed at demonstrating different design and performance aspects. A notable feature is the implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm directly in the processor's memory, showcasing its functionality.

## Project Structure

- **MIPS Ciclu Unic**: Contains VHDL files for the single-cycle MIPS processor.
- **MIPS PIPELINE**: Contains VHDL files for the pipelined MIPS processor.

Each folder has a `Documentatie.docx` for detailed documentation on design and implementation.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Review the documentation** in `Documentatie.docx` in either folder to understand the processor designs.
3. **Use VHDL tools** to simulate and synthesize the designs.

## Requirements

- A VHDL-compatible simulation and synthesis tool.
